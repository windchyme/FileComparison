# FileComparison
Tools are available to compare different file types. The goal is to try to create a tool that can compare two files and give important insights from the data.
**Command line tools:**
1. diff (Linux/macOS): Compares line-by-line differences between text files.
Usage: diff file1.txt file2.txt
2. cmp (Linux/macOS): Compares two files byte by byte; better for binary files.
Usage: cmp file1.bin file2.bin
3. fc (Windows Command Prompt): Compares text or binary files.
Usage: fc file1.txt file2.txt
4. git diff: Used in version control to compare file changes in repositories.

**GUI Tools**
1. WinMerge (Windows): Free and open-source; great for comparing and merging text files and directories.
2. Meld (Windows, macOS, Linux): Clean interface; good for diffing files, directories, and version control repositories.
3. Beyond Compare (Windows, macOS, Linux via Wine): Paid tool; powerful and customizable; supports text, binary, image, and folder comparisons.
4. KDiff3 (Windows, Linux, macOS): Three-way merge and diff tool; supports text and directory comparisons.
5. Araxis Merge (Windows, macOS): Professional-grade tool; ideal for legal or software development comparisons.
